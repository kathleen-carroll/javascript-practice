    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    const new = players

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    new[2] = "Dog"

    console.log(new)
    console.log(players)

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const new2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const new3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const new4 = [...players];

    const new5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    new4[1] = "Kathleen";
    console.log(new4)
    console.log(players)

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const wes = person;
    wes.age = 100;

    console.log(wes);
    console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const wes2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12})
    console.log(wes2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
